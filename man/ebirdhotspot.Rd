\title{Recent observations at hotspots}
\usage{
ebirdhotspot(locID, species = NULL, back = NULL, max = NULL,
  locale = NULL, provisional = FALSE, sleep = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{locID}{(required) Vector containing code(s) for up to 10 regions of
interest; here, regions are the locIDs of hotspots. Values that are not
valid or are not hotspots are ignored.}

\item{species}{Scientific name of the species of interest (not case
sensitive). Defaults to NULL, in which case sightings for all species
are returned.
See eBird taxonomy for more information:
http://ebird.org/content/ebird/about/ebird-taxonomy}

\item{back}{Number of days back to look for observations (between
1 and 30, defaults to 14).}

\item{max}{Maximum number of result rows to return in this request
(between 1 and 10000, defaults to all)}

\item{locale}{Language/locale of response (when translations are available).
See http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html
(defaults to en_US)}

\item{provisional}{Should flagged records that have not been reviewed
be included? (defaults to FALSE)}

\item{sleep}{Time (in seconds) before function sends API call (defaults to
zero.  Set to higher number if you are using this function in a loop with
many API calls).}

\item{...}{Curl options passed on to \code{\link[httr]{GET}}}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing the collected information:

"comName": species common name

"howMany": number of individuals observed, NA if only presence was noted

"lat": latitude of the location

"lng": longitude of the location

"locID": unique identifier for the location

"locName": location name

"locationPrivate": TRUE if location is not a birding hotspot

"obsDt": observation date formatted according to ISO 8601
   (e.g. 'YYYY-MM-DD', or 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm'). Hours and minutes are excluded
   if the observer did not report an observation time.

"obsReviewed": TRUE if observation has been reviewed, FALSE otherwise

"obsValid": TRUE if observation has been deemed valid by either the
   automatic filters or a regional viewer, FALSE otherwise

"sciName" species' scientific name
}
